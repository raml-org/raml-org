            <p>Irresistible APIs provides step-by-step guidance for designing APIs that reflect an application's core business value, delight the developers who use them, and will stand the test of time. In it, business product managers and developers learn to treat an API as a first class product. You’ll discover what questions to ask during design so that the first version is the best possible product. Because APIs are a combination of a business need and a technical implementation, exercises throughout the book present both sides of the design process, so that you can engage with the material that's most comfortable and relevant for you. When you finish, your team will be able to design APIs that attract developers, lead your industry, and add value to your core business.</p>

            <p>Believe it or not, building an API is the easy part. What is far more challenging is to put together an API design that will stand the test of time, while also meeting your developers' needs. After all, no matter how well written your code may be, without a strong foundation, you will find your API quickly failing.</p>
