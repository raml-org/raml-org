<p>RAML is backed by a generous community of developers, engineers, architects, and companies that want to push the API
    space forward.</p><p>This community is open to all, and contributions are welcomed!!! There are several ways to
    contribute to RAML:</p><h2>Contributing to the Spec</h2><p>If you have ideas or find problems with the spec, please
    raise an issue in the <a href="https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/issues" target="_blank">Spec Github
        Repository</a>.</p><h2>Creating an Open source Project</h2><p>Open source is the lifeblood of RAML – and we
    welcome all types of projects in our <a href="/projects">Projects Library</a>. To get started, take a look at some
    of the many parsers already available for RAML (or feel free to create your own) and once your project is ready to
    share just send us an email at info@raml.org and we'll add it to the library!</p><h2>Adding RAML to a Paid
    Service</h2><p>You are absolutely 100% free to add RAML to any service you create, free or paid. The only thing we
    ask (for legal reasons) is that if you advertise you support RAML (which is AWESOME) that you adhere to our <a
            href="/legal">brand guidelines</a>.</p><p>Oh, and we’d love for you to add your service to our list of
    services supporting RAML in our Services Library.</p><p>For more information, please read the <a
        href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0" target="_blank">Apache 2</a> license and our <a
        href="/legal">brand policy</a>.</p><h2>Partner with RAML</h2><p>Want to do more? Email us at <a href="mailto:info@raml.org" target="_top">info@raml.org</a>
