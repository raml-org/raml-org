                <p>With RAML, you can design your API in minutes using plain text. It can be edited by developers, technical writers and even your CEO. You can not only visually see the design (and catch flaws) but also test out a mock of your API with other users - all before your engineers start coding. </p>

The mock API can also be used by other development teams such as mobile and app teams. Using existing design templates will eliminate design bugs,  cut down cycle times and accelerate your speed of innovation. </p>
