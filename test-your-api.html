<h2>Testing Made Easy</h2>
<p>Unit Tests are absolutely crucial to ensuring that your API doesn’t have any backwards compatibility breaks and meets all of your current requirements.  With RAML you’re able to describe your HTTP REST API in such a way that it’s possible to generate many of those tests for you!!!</p>

<p>This means that after defining your spec, you’re able to take advantage of TDD (Test Driven Development) and have automatically generated tests in your CI (Continuous Integration) environments.</p>

<h2>Popular Testing Tools</h2>

<p>There are several tools that you can use to generate tests with RAML, including many available for free in the community, and other far more extensive testing services offered through companies such as API Science and SmartBear.</p>

<h3>Abao</h3>
<p>Abao is a NodeJS command-line tool for testing API documentation written in RAML format against its backend implementation. With Abao you can easily plug your API documentation into the Continuous Integration system like Travis CI or Jenkins and have API documentation up-to-date, all the time. Abao uses Mocha (http://mochajs.org/) for judging if a particular API response is valid or if is not.</p>
