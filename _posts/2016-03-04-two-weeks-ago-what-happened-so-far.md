And there is obviously more love that has been spread since the last 2 weeks. Thanks to everyone.

The last 2 weeks have been amazing driven by the community making everything we’ve done around RAML 1.0 and the API Workbench looking like a huge success. Thanks for everyone who participated in the feedback rounds we had for the 1.0 spec. You contribution will make RAML even better.

What’s next you might wonder. As we released RAML 1.0 as a Release Candidate (RC) to gather more feedback from the community to see if the changes actually make sense to everyone, we obviously want to get the final version of the specification out by the end of this month. We also work with MuleSoft to improve the experience with the API Workbench to prepare for the next set of tooling that will be introduced post November. We will keep you posted around these in another article. Going away from the tooling, technology, and spec; we are also planning to do hangouts with the community to talk about existing or upcoming projects as well as session to talk to some of the workgroup members directly.

It's getting more exciting. :)
