<p>RAML makes it easy to build your API by turning your spec into code with server-side generators in several different languages including NodeJS, Java, .NET, and Python - with more being added every single day.  You can see all projects for building APIs with RAML in the <a href="/projects">Projects Library</a>, but here are just a few:</p>

<h2>NodeJS</h2>

<h3>Osprey</h3>

<p>Osprey is a JavaScript framework for rapidly building applications that expose RAML APIs. It’s based on Node and Express.</p>

<h2>Java</h2>

<h3>Restlet</h3>

<p>With Restlet Framework's powerful routing and filtering capabilities, unified client and server Java API, developers can build secure and scalable RESTful web APIs. It is available for all major platforms (Java SE/EE, Google AppEngine, OSGi, GWT, Android) and offers numerous extensions to fit the needs of all developers.</p>

<h3>RAML for JAX-RS</h3>

<p>The goal of RAML for JAX-RS is to provide a set of tools to work with these technologies to build your API in a way of being able to scaffold a JAVA + JAX-RS application based on an existing RAML API definition (Code Generation), or its roundtrip, generate the RAML API definition based on an existing JAVA + JAX-RS application (Documentation).</p>

<br />
<h2>.NET</h2>

<h3>RAML Tools for .NET</h3>

<p>RAML Tools for .NET allows developers to easily integrate and consume APIs that expose a RAML definition, or create a new ASP.NET Web API implementation using a contract-first approach from a previously created RAML definition. A single tools package provides support for both client and service code-generation scenarios. The tools are provided as a Visual Studio extension, allowing simple and natural integration of RAML into a normal development workflow.</p>

<h2>Python</h2>

<h3>Flask-RAML</h3>
<p>Flask-RAML (REST API Markup Language) generates an API server with parameter conversion, response encoding, and examples.</p>

<br />
<h3>raml-python</h3>

<p>RAML-python uses NodeJS to generate a framework for your API in Python.</p>

<br />
<h3>RAMSES</h3>

<p>RAML + Elasticsearch + Pyramid = REST API. Ramses is a library that generates a RESTful API using RAML. It uses Pyramid and Nefertari which provides ElasticSearch-powered views.</p>

<h2>Mule</h2>

<h3>APIkit</h3>

<p>APIkit is a declarative toolkit that leverages RAML to build and facilitate the implementation of APIs. It uses RAML as the definition of the API, which can then be used with APIkit Maven- and Mule Studio-based tools for mocking the interface and implementing its backend using Mule flows.</p>

<h2>IOT</h2>

<h3>Nobel</h3>

<p>Nobel (code-generator) creates a REST API for your Arduino board, based on a RAML definition.</p>
