title: What's New in RAML 1.0
permalink: /developers/whats-new-raml-10
---

<p>RAML 1.0 is all about empowering developers with even more extensibility, code reuse options, and flexibility.</p>

<p>This includes exciting new features such as <strong>libraries, overlays, improved examples, improved security schemas, annotations,</strong> and <strong>data-typing</strong>.  Here's just a little bit more on each of these features, and how they make designing, building, testing, documenting, and sharing your API even easier.  Of course, you can always read the <a href="/raml-10-spec">full spec</a> to learn more.</p>

<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>Libraries provide the ability to bring in pre-defined sets of data-types, resourceTypes, traits, security schemas, and reusable assets - all in a namespaced environment.</p>

<pre>
#%RAML 1.0
title: A CRUD API for Users and Groups
mediaType: application/json

uses:
  Common: libraries/types/common.raml
  User:   libraries/types/user.raml
  Group:  libraries/types/group.raml
  CRUD:   libraries/resourceTypes/crud.raml

/users:
  description: All the users
  type:
    CRUD.collection:
      typename: User.full
      typename-new: User.new
</pre>

<h2>Overlays</h2>
<p>Overlays let you add an additional layer to your RAML file and include new information such as descriptions, annotations, and examples - letting you extend your main RAML file for different internal and external API use cases.</p>

<h2>Improved Security Schemas</h2>
<p>Substantial improvements have been made to enhance security schema support in RAML 1.0, including improved support for OAuth (1&2) and a brand new "Pass Through" schema

    oauth_2_0:
      description: |
          Dropbox supports OAuth 2.0 for authenticating all API requests.
      type: OAuth 2.0
      describedBy:
          headers:
              Authorization:
                  description: |
                     Used to send a valid OAuth 2 access token. Do not use
                     with the "access_token" query string parameter.

          queryParameters:

                  description: |
                     Used to send a valid OAuth 2 access token. Do not use together with the "Authorization" header
                  type: string
          responses:
              401:
                  description: |
                      Bad or expired token. This can happen if the user or Dropbox
                      revoked or expired an access token. To fix, you should re-
                      authenticate the user.
              403:
                  description: |
                      Bad OAuth request (wrong consumer key, bad nonce, expired
                      timestamp...). Unfortunately, re-authenticating the user won't help here.

</pre>

<h2>Annotations</h2>
<p>Annotations, or a way to extend your RAML specification to support specific third-party vendor needs without breaking or changing your specification have now been added.  Using annotations and overlays you can now meet specialized use-case needs all without having to worry about breaking backwards compatibility with other services.</p>

</pre>

<h2>Data Types</h2>
<p>Perhaps the crown jewel in RAML 1.0, data types serve as a way of replacing daunting schemas and provide even more information for consumers and code generators to ensure that they understand and meet your API data type needs.</p>
<p>Data Types can be used in place of schemas and examples, letting you define one Data Type that can then be converted into an XML or JSON Schema on the fly - letting you simply define your data model, and letting RAML take care of the REST.</p>
